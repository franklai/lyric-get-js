Coastline

歌手：Hollow Coves


[Verse 1]
I'm leaving home for the coastline
Some place under the sun
I feel my heart for the first time
'Cause now I'm moving on, yeah, I'm moving on

[Verse 2]
And there's a place that I've dreamed of
Where I can free my mind
I hear the sounds of the season
And lose all sense of time

[Chorus]
I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean

[Verse 3]
The summer air by the seaside
The way it fills our lungs
The fire burns in the night sky
This life will keep us young, yeah, keep us young

[Verse 4]
And we will sleep by the ocean
Our hearts will move with the tide
And we will wake in the morning
To see the sun paint the sky

[Chorus]
I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean
I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean
